Shinto
Shinto is one of Japan's older religions#1 and is one of the major religions. Unlike many other religions with a sacred text, Shinto is rooted in the traditions and customs for Japanese people. The commonly used term kami, meaning gods, originates in Shinto. They are considered as sacred spirits and can come in many forms such as nature in the trees, mountains, and rivers which are often seen in Japanese films such as Princess Mononoke. Shinto is a religion based on practices such as laying offerings to kami to keep them appeased such as during festivals called matsuri, or with the erection of shrines for certain kami.#1 The word Shinto literally meant "the way of kami" which emphasises the importance of kami to this practice.#2
One of the main purposes of Shinto is the idea of purity and keeping this purity#1. Purity is an essential and important virtue that must be kept even in daily life. Purification in Shinto involves not only a pure mind including "moral virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, love, faithfulness, and so forth"#2, but also in keeping purity physically. There are many prayers and practices for the purification of places and objects. for instance, there are ceremonies for the purification and blessing in daily life "such as a ceremony of purifying a building site or for setting up the framework for a new building, a firing or purifying ceremony for the boilers in a new factory".#2

Buddhism
Buddhism is a large religion ranging all over the world. There are many variations and differences from country to country, region to region, and even within countries. In japan, there are many versions of Buddhism and these can be seen in many films. This page will go into a brief introduction to some of these sects and types of Buddhist practices in Japan. One of the main points of Buddhism in japan, is that Buddhism is associated with death. The Shinto religion relieves heavily on purity and death is considered a polluting practice, hence, Buddhist commonly take over and oversee funeral practices.#1 this association is a common theme in films.
As well, there are many other types of Buddhism in Japan that although may not be practiced currently, draw many inspirations in films. One of these being the sohei who are warrior monks. These were a sect of monks that took up arms, which is a drastic opposite from the peaceful image of typical Buddhists. the existence of these monks came about when Buddhism was brought to Japan. As an imported religion to Japan where there was a lack of central authority to regulate Buddhism; this brought on the role of the sohei class.#3 these warrior monks are a trope often seen in movies. Perhaps not sohei specifically, but the ideas of monks able to fight. this might have been the inspiration for Star Wars even!
Onmyodo
Onmyodo is an interesting religion as it is based heavily on techniques. Onmyoji, literally translates to way of yin and yang, includes many aspects from various religions.#5 (pg. 1, 3) Daoism plays a role in Onmyodo, specifically with the use of practices in yin-yang divination. One of the most universal symbols of this is the circular yin-yang symbol with the half back and white halves. The use of the "purification of the directions" is a central Daoist concept taken into onmyodo.#4 (826) Watch out for this in many films, as this shows up often such as in the movie Onmyoji! 
Speaking of the movie, Onmyoji, one of the central characters for this film is Abe no Seimei who is a famous Onmyodo practitioner called onmyoji.#6 He is a popular figure in the history of Onmyodo for the many practices and stories about his life.
Bushido
Tom Cruise's the Last samurai depicts an honourable code for the samurai class as seen in popular culture. However, this view of Bushido code and samurai are quite contrary to the actual times. The code of Bushido in popular culture comes from Inazo Nitabe's book, Bushido: The Soul of Japan, published in 1900. This book melded together Christian perspectives on the more savage aspects of Bushido such as seppuku (slitting one's gut for an honourable death) among many others to justify these in a Christian pesective.#7 The common values and views of Bushido lead for an honourable life following key virtues. These virtues include adhering to the law, courage in facing times of adversity, honouring emotions, and respecting others, to be truthful and sincere to oneself and others, and the duty and loyalty to service and agreements.#8 These can be often seen in films, but in particular the corrupted samurai can also be seen in films. samurai that have lost to greed and corruption, straying from the promised honourable lives such as in the movie Ugetsu.
Yokai
If you have watched Japanese anime, you may have heard to term yokai before. The term yokai is a general word for "supernatural beings and folktale creatures" including everything and anything from ghosts, goblins, fairies and so on.#9 Some popular yokai in Japanese tales include animal inspired yokai such as Pokémon are yokai! Another popular yokai animal is the racoon dogs known as tanuki. these creatures can be seen in the movie Pom Poko and are known as mischief makers.#10 there are not harmful creature as seen in Pom Poko but able to use magic and pranksters at heart. See more of a typical tanuki's prank in the Pom Poko analysis! another popular animal yokai are kitsune or fox spirits. although there is a class of kami fox such as under Inari foxes which are considered to be messengers to the gods, there are also less benevolent versions of known as the yokai class of foxes.#11 These foxes are more mischievous and causing harm. the main power of yokai foxes are their ability to create illusions and disguise themselves as humans for evil purposes.#11 There are also other non-animal yokai, as they can come in many shapes and forms. For instance, daily objects can be seen as yokai as well such as an umbrella with human features such as feet and a face.
Kaiju
One of the most popular kaiju is Godzilla or pronounced Gojira in Japanese. A giant radioactive lizard coming from the depths and wreaking havoc and destruction on a city is the type mode of operations of a typical kaiju monster. However, there are a great many other kaiju that have since appear since Godzilla such as King Kong the giant gorilla, giant insects, giant octopuses and so on.#12 The kaiju genre of films came about in 1953 when the first Godzilla movie was made. The film, titled The Beast from 20, 000 fathoms, was one of the first movies to 'associate nuclear weapons with giant, destructive creatures".#13 A deeper look at the battle royal and comical at times. The genera of kaiju monsters have since expanded to not only include the destruction of cities, but also the major clashes against other kaiju in the back drop of Tokyo getting demolished. However, there is a deeper take on the genre if you take a closer look. the destruction by huge monsters, usually as a result of nuclear by-products, reflects the fears and worries in industrialized city with the fast paced and sometimes destructive tendencies from scientific advancements such as world wars and the cold war.
Ghosts
Like in many other cultures, Japan too has many stories and traditions relating to ghosts. The spirits of the dead take on many different forms or classes. One of these being yurei. yurei are ghosts that have been bound to earth. As seen in Shinto with kami, the spirits of the deceased with proper rituals and rites can ascend and become a kami or "protective ancestor diety".#14 However, of these special rites and customs are not performed, then a yurei is formed. a yurei is a spirited that need to be calm or pacified since they continue to long for something that keeps them bound to the world of the living.#14 often these stories with yurei can offer a good moral lesson and word of warning such as in the story of the girl that fell into the well a popular yurei story. 
Although most yurei are not deadly, but cause fear and fright in the living, there is a class of ghosts that are not as harmless. These vengeful spirits are known as onyro. Most often when a women, when a person needs a "sudden of violent death such as murder or suicide" an onyro is born.#15 Deep seated emotions including revenge, jealousy, hate, and sorrow at the moment of their demise can also keep a person's soul trapped and turned into an ontryo.#15 This theme of female onyro is a typical concept often seen in horror ghost movies in japan such as the internationally known series The grudge and the ring. Often these ghosts are seen dressed in white clothing with long black hair covering the face. The prominent feature that most of these onyro are women comes from the vulnerable and powerlessness women tend to face in times of mistreatment. For instance, in the films the grudge, the onyro of Kayako was abused and murdered by her husband.
