Shinto
Shinto is one of Japan's older religions#1 and is one of the major religions. Unlike many other religions with a sacred text, Shinto is rooted in the traiditons and customs for Japanese people. THe comonly used term kami, meaning gods, orignates in Shinto. They are considered as sacred spirits and can come in many forms such as nature in the trees, mountains, and rivers which are often seen in Japanese films such as Princess Monoke. Shinto is a religion based on practices such as laying offerings to kami to keep them appeased such as during festivals called matsuri, or with the erection of shirnes for certain kami.#1 The word Shinto literally meant "the way of kami" which emphasises the impirtance of kami to this practice.#2
One of the main purposes of Shinto is the idea of purity and mainitaing this purity#1. Purity is an esental and important viture that must be kept even in daily life. Purification in shinto invloves not only a pure mind including "moral virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, love, faithfulness, and so forth"#2, but also in keeping purity physically. There are many prayers and practices for the purifitcation of places and objects. for instance, there are ceremonies for the purification and blessing in daily life "such as a ceremony of purifying a building site or for setting up the framework for a new building, a firing or purifying ceremony for the boilers in a new factory".#2

Buddhism
Buddhism is a large religion ranging all over the world. THere are many varaitions and differences from country to contry, region to region, and even within countires. In japan, there are many versions of Buddhism and these can be seen in many films. THis page will go into a brief introduction to some of these sects and types of Buddhist pracitces in Japan. One of the main points of Biddhism in japan, is that Buddhism is accositated with death. The Shinto religion relieves heavily on purity and death is conseiders a polluting pracitices, hence, Buddhist commonly take over and are in charge of funeral practices.#1 this assocaition is a common theme in films.
As well, there are many other types of buddhism in Japan that although may not be practiced currently, draw many inspriations in films. One of these being the sohei who are warrior monks. These were a sect of monks that took up arms, which is a drastic oppostie from the peaceful image of typical Buddhists. the existstence of these mnks came about when Buddhism was brought to Japan. As an imported religion to Jpan where there was a lack of central authority to regulate buddhism; this brought on the role of the sohei class.#3 these warrior monks are a trope often seen in movies. Perhaps not sohei specifically, but the ideas of monks able to fight. this might have been the inpsiration for star wars even!
Onmyodo
Onmyodo is an interesting religion as it is based heaily on techniques. Onmyoji litearlly translates to way of yin and yang, and has many inlcudeces from various religions.#5 (pg 1, 3) Doasim plays a role in onmyodo, specifically with the use of practices in yin-yang divination. One of the most universal symbols of this is the circular yin-yang symbol with the half bakc and white halves. The use of the "purification of the directions" is a central doaist concept taken into onmyodo.#4 (826) Watch out for this in many films, as this shows up often such as in the movie Onmyoji! 
Speaking of the movie, Onmyoji, one of the central characters for this film is Abe no Seimei who is a famous onmyodo practicitonar called onmyoji.#6 He is a popular figure in the histry of onmyodo for the many practices and stories about his life.
Bushido
Tom cruise's the Last samurai depicts a honourable code for the samurai class as seen in popular culture. Howevver, this view of Bushido code and samurai are quite contrary to the actual times. The code of Bushido in popular cultrue comes from Inazo Nitabe's book, Bushido: THe SOul of Japan, published in 1900. This book meled together a Chirsitan perspetives on the more svage aspects of Bushido such as speeku (sliting one's gut for an honourable death) among many others to justify these in a Chistiran pesective.#7 The common values and views of Bushido lead for an honourable life following key vitures. These vitrues include adhering to the law, courage in facing times of adversity, honouring emotions and respecting others, to be truthful and sinsere ton onerself and others, and the duty and loaytly to service and agreements.#8 These can be often seen in films, but in partiular the corrupted samuria can also be seen in films. samrai that have lost to greed and corruption, straying from the promosed honourable lives suchas in the movie Ugetsu.
Yokai
If you have watched Jpanaese anime, you may have heard to therm yokai before. The term yokai is a genral word for "supernatural beigns and foltalk creatures" including everything and anything from ghsots, goblisn, fairies and so on.#9 Some popular yokai in Japanese tales include animorphaised yokai such as pokemon are yokai! Another popular yokai animal is the racoon dogs known as tanuki. these creatures can be seen in the movie Pom poko and are known as micheif makers.#10 thear are not harmful creature as seen in pom poko but able to use magic and pranksters at heart. See more of a typical tanuki's prank in the pom poko anylisys! another popluar naiml yokai are kitsune or fox spirits. although there is a class of kami fox such as under Inari foxes which are considered to be messengars to the gods, there are also less benevolent versions of known as the yokai class of foxes.#11 These foxes are more more mscihvioues and coausing harm. the main power of yokau foxes are thier abililty to creat illusions and disguse themselves as humans for evil purposes.#11 There are also other non-animal yokai, as they can come in many shaes and forms. For isntance, daily objects can be seen as yokai as well such as an umbrella with human features such as feets and a face.
Kaiju
One of the most popular kaiju is Godzilla or pornounced Gojira in Japanese. A giant raadiotctive lizrad coming from the depths and wreacking havoc and destuction on a city is th typel mode ofoperations of a typical kaiju onster. However, there are a great many other kaiju that have since appread since godzilla such as King Kong the giant gorilla, giant insects, giatn octipuses and so on.#12 The kaiju genre of films came about in 1953 when the first godzilla movie was made. THe film, titled THe Beast from 20, 000 fathoms, was one of the first moveis to 'associate nuclear weaons with giast, destuctuve creatures".#13 A deeper look at the battle royale and comical at tiems. The genera of kaiju monsters has since expanded to not nly inlue the desction of cities, but also the maor clashes against other kaijus in the back drop of tokyo getting demonlished. However, there is a deeper take on the genre if you take a lcoser look. the destruction by huge monseters, usually as a ecuslt of nuclear by-products, is a refelctin of the fears and wories in industrialized scaited with the fast pasced and sometjes desutrctive tendencies from societifca advancements such as world wars and the cold war.
Ghosts
Like in many other cultures, Japan too has many stories and traditions relating to ghosts. The spirits of the dead take on many diffrent forms or classes. One of these being yurei. yurei are ghosts that have been bound to earth. As seen in Shinto with kami, the spritis of the deceased with poprer ritals and ries can ascend and become a kami or "protective ancestor diety".#14 However, of these speical rite and more performed, then a yurei is formed. a yurei is a psirted that need to be calm or pacified sicne they contunie to long for something that keeps them bound to the world of the living.#14 often these sotreis with yurei can offer a good moral lesson and word of warning such as in the sotry of the girl that fell into the well a popular yurei story. 
Although most yurei are not deadly, ut cause fear and fright in the living, there is a class of ghosts that are not as harmless. these are known as onyro whom are vengeful spirits. Most often when a women, when a person meeds a "suddent of violnet death suchas muder or suicide" an onyro is born.#15 Deep seated emtions including revenge, jealousy, hate, and sorrow at the moment of their demise can also keep a person's soul trapped and turned into an ontryo.#15 This theme of female onyro is a typical concept often seen in horror ghost movies in japan such as the internatilaly known serioes The grude and the ring. Often these ghosts are seen dressed in white clothing with long balck hair covering th face. The porminent feature that most of these ontyro are woemn comes from the vulnerable and powerlessness women tned to face in times of mistreatment. For instance, in the films the grudge, the onyro of Kayako was abused and murdered by her husband.
