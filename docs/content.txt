Shinto
Shinto is one of Japan's older religions#1 and is one of the major religions. Unlike many other religions with a sacred text, Shinto is rooted in the traiditons and customs for Japanese people. THe comonly used term kami, meaning gods, orignates in Shinto. They are considered as sacred spirits and can come in many forms such as nature in the trees, mountains, and rivers which are often seen in Japanese films such as Princess Monoke. Shinto is a religion based on practices such as laying offerings to kami to keep them appeased such as during festivals called matsuri, or with the erection of shirnes for certain kami.#1 The word Shinto literally meant "the way of kami" which emphasises the impirtance of kami to this practice.#2
One of the main purposes of Shinto is the idea of purity and mainitaing this purity#1. Purity is an esental and important viture that must be kept even in daily life. Purification in shinto invloves not only a pure mind including "moral virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, love, faithfulness, and so forth"#2, but also in keeping purity physically. There are many prayers and practices for the purifitcation of places and objects. for instance, there are ceremonies for the purification and blessing in daily life "such as a ceremony of purifying a building site or for setting up the framework for a new building, a firing or purifying ceremony for the boilers in a new factory".#2

Buddhism
Buddhism is a large religion ranging all over the world. THere are many varaitions and differences from country to contry, region to region, and even within countires. In japan, there are many versions of Buddhism and these can be seen in many films. THis page will go into a brief introduction to some of these sects and types of Buddhist pracitces in Japan. One of the main points of Biddhism in japan, is that Buddhism is accositated with death. The Shinto religion relieves heavily on purity and death is conseiders a polluting pracitices, hence, Buddhist commonly take over and are in charge of funeral practices.#1 this assocaition is a common theme in films.
As well, there are many other types of buddhism in Japan that although may not be practiced currently, draw many inspriations in films. One of these being the sohei who are warrior monks. These were a sect of monks that took up arms, which is a drastic oppostie from the peaceful image of typical Buddhists. the existstence of these mnks came about when Buddhism was brought to Japan. As an imported religion to Jpan where there was a lack of central authority to regulate buddhism; this brought on the role of the sohei class.#3 these warrior monks are a trope often seen in movies. Perhaps not sohei specifically, but the ideas of monks able to fight. this might have been the inpsiration for star wars even!
Onmyodo
Onmyodo is an interesting religion as it is based heaily on techniques. Onmyoji litearlly translates to way of yin and yang, and has many inlcudeces from various religions.#5 (pg 1, 3) Doasim plays a role in onmyodo, specifically with the use of practices in yin-yang divination. One of the most universal symbols of this is the circular yin-yang symbol with the half bakc and white halves. The use of the "purification of the directions" is a central doaist concept taken into onmyodo.#4 (826) Watch out for this in many films, as this shows up often such as in the movie Onmyoji! 
Speaking of the movie, Onmyoji, one of the central characters for this film is Abe no Seimei who is a famous onmyodo practicitonar called onmyoji.#6 He is a popular figure in the histry of onmyodo for the many practices and stories about his life.
Bushido
Tom cruise's the Last samurai depicts a honourable code for the samurai class as seen in popular culture. Howevver, this view of Bushido code and samurai are quite contrary to the actual times. The code of Bushido in popular cultrue comes from Inazo Nitabe's book, Bushido: THe SOul of Japan, published in 1900. This book meled together a Chirsitan perspetives on the more svage aspects of Bushido such as speeku (sliting one's gut for an honourable death) among many others to justify these in a Chistiran pesective.#7 The common values and views of Bushido lead for an honourable life following key vitures. These vitrues include adhering to the law, courage in facing times of adversity, honouring emotions and respecting others, to be truthful and sinsere ton onerself and others, and the duty and loaytly to service and agreements.#8 These can be often seen in films, but in partiular the corrupted samuria can also be seen in films. samrai that have lost to greed and corruption, straying from the promosed honourable lives suchas in the movie Ugetsu.
