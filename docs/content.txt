Shinto
Shinto is one of Japan's older religions#1 and is one of the major religions. Unlike many other religions with a sacred text, Shinto is rooted in the traiditons and customs for Japanese people. THe comonly used term kami, meaning gods, orignates in Shinto. They are considered as sacred spirits and can come in many forms such as nature in the trees, mountains, and rivers which are often seen in Japanese films such as Princess Monoke. Shinto is a religion based on practices such as laying offerings to kami to keep them appeased such as during festivals called matsuri, or with the erection of shirnes for certain kami.#1 The word Shinto literally meant "the way of kami" which emphasises the impirtance of kami to this practice.#2
One of the main purposes of Shinto is the idea of purity and mainitaing this purity#1. Purity is an esental and important viture that must be kept even in daily life. Purification in shinto invloves not only a pure mind including "moral virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, love, faithfulness, and so forth"#2, but also in keeping purity physically. There are many prayers and practices for the purifitcation of places and objects. for instance, there are ceremonies for the purification and blessing in daily life "such as a ceremony of purifying a building site or for setting up the framework for a new building, a firing or purifying ceremony for the boilers in a new factory".#2
